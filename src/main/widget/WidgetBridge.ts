/**
 * Feeds the macOS WidgetKit extension (PRD §26 in spirit — glanceable control
 * outside the app window).
 *
 * Two files go into the shared App Group container:
 *
 *   - `widget-state.json` — a denormalised snapshot of what the app currently
 *     knows. The widget falls back to it when the bridge is unreachable.
 *   - `widget-credentials.json` — bridge address and application key, so the
 *     widget can query and control the bridge on its own, including while the
 *     app is not running.
 *
 * Exporting the key is a deliberate trade-off: it leaves the Keychain-backed
 * store for a 0600 file readable by anything running as this user. A Hue
 * application key only grants control of local lighting — it is not an account
 * credential — and unpairing deletes the file again.
